# Specifications

This directory is the repo-level specification entry point. Detailed specs and architecture decisions live here and in each package’s `spec/` directory.

- **Code organization**: See the [mtngTOOLS code organization](https://github.com/mtngtools/overview/blob/main/code-organization.md) and [overview](https://github.com/mtngtools/overview) for layers (UTILS, CORE, FRAME, PROVIDE, COMPOSE) and dependency rules.
- **Submodules**: See [SUBMODULES.md](../SUBMODULES.md) for submodules (e.g. `sub/hls`).
- New features should not be implemented until specifications are updated and approved.
